----

Text: Second Sight Issue #29 is about Making Worlds – New poppystyles, Manga, Lady Gaga, also David Bowie is back – also stories sell and storytelling is emerging business. Words create worlds. With a huge belief in the human ability, in craftmaking, new brotherhoods and much more. This is about small scaleness, but about numbers too. This issue is about creativity, about creating new worlds and human skills.
