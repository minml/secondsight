Title: Second Sight #36 – RETHINKING ETHICS

----

Text: Second Sight’s winter 2014 issue is about Ethics. Rethinking Ethics, as we called it. Since moving from an atoms to a bits era everyone can copy everything. Even brains and DNA’s can be copied now. What about robotics and responsibility? In this new era new questions arise. The landscape changed, also the economy. Young people are rethinking ethics now. What is their future? They are new thinkers, they are concerned about their privacy. What is the future of humanity on the long term? Technology – we are becoming super humans, what does that mean? For imprinsonment, for healthcare? For food and fashion? This issue is also about the economy. 

There is a shift going on from men and money to men with morals, as Susanne Piët calls it. Also space for new arts, for respect. What does dignity and virtue mean in 2014? What about Asia and in Africa? How did ethics change during last centuries?
