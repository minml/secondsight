Text: This year Second Sight organises another (link: http://projects.minml.co/project/twoty/the-annual-twoty-awards text: TWOTY Awards)! On September 12, 2014 the TWOTY Awards are going to be given to the best visionairies, trendwatchers, forecasters, futurists and upcoming talents – in Amsterdam.

Same as last year this the awards focus is on the content of future stories, on insights and visions for the future. Only with the best insights, views and visions we can think about that future. Also in 2014 four prizes will be awarded:

**TRENDWATCHER OF THE YEAR**
**TREND FORECASTER OF THE YEAR**
**FUTURIST OF THE YEAR**
**UPCOMING TALENT OF THE YEAR**

The submission for the TWOTY Awards is open. Everyone who is a professional foresight expert can submit. That means that you can be either a trendwatcher, forecaster, futurist or you work with trends and futures daily. As foresight manager or as other porfessional. We accept entries from the Netherlands and from abroad.

# THE FOUR AWARDS

**The Trend Watcher Of The Year**
Entries should be a story about the spirit of our time – a lifestyle, a new development, a trending topic interesting to write a story or insight on. For instance decentralization, frugal living, collaborative consumption and more interesting things that are happening and changing now. Let it be the talk of the town!

**The Trend Forecaster Of The Year**
Entries should be about new and emerging topics, lifestyles or trends that are interesting for the industry to focus on or to prepare for.

**The Futurist Of The Year**
Entries should be about topics, ideas or visions on the future further away – the distant future. What’s the new spot on the horizon? How do we work or live in 2050 or 2080? It can be science fiction writing or a story about a future development (nurtured by science or art). Who dares?

# THE JURY PROCESS

During the Award ceremony 4 prizes will be given by a panel of client executives who are experienced in working with future insights and creating it. The jury will study the entries which are anonymous brought to them. After reading the stories, the juries will shortlist 3 stories. From these entries the Second Sight editors will also make a short assessment – they get questions – and will enrich the stories if needed. After this research the jury will choose a winner!
