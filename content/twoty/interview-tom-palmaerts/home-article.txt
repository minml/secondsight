# TOM PALMAERTS WINT TWOTY 2013

**Tom, congratulations with the TWOTY Award 13!  You are busy, now even more – can you tell us something about your daily work?**

I spend a lot of my time on the road, visiting clients or giving lectures. I try to be one day a week at the office to gather all the information from our researchers and to think about research opportunities. My best day starts with a great coffee and the time to have a conversation with startups and creatives. My network is really important for me. I try to meet a lot of people while traveling.

I’m an information nerd. Blogs, newspapers, Twitter, … I’m always optimising the way I gather and filter information. Last year we started a trend database where we store the most interesting coolhunts. We have trend spotters all around Europe who enter local and international, market and consumer trends. It is the perfect base to start our analysis.

For TWOTY 13 we as Second Sight chose for Michael Jackson and his song Will You Be There? and pop culture – as last year we did with David Bowie/ Golden Years – how important is the pop culture for young people now? Can you declare that?

Pop culture is very important! It tells a lot about the era we live in. For young people pop culture offers an anchor in their search for identity. The ruling attitudes and ideas guide them and inspire them. Pop culture is driven by creatives and artists looking for answers on contemporary issues. Older artists – like Michael Jackson – can all of a sudden be very in the moment again. Or sometimes it is just a line from an old song that gets popular. For example, what Leonard Cohen stated in his 1992 song Anthem. “There is a crack in everything. That’s how the light gets in.” A reflection of todays appreciation for imperfection.

**You made a wonderful Trend Report 2013, with the Trendwolves team. What is the most interesting trend amongst you? And why? Or more…**

The most fascinating trends for me are raw culture, suspicious minds and dreamotion. Life gets rougher, young people question traditions and institutions, and they free up time to wander and dream. These consumer trends will give an answer on the negative views on the future.  

**What is 2014 about? Different from 2013? And if, how?**

The future is here. And the kids are building it. They will start writing love letters again.
The power of young entrepreneurs and influencers is disruptive for our society. We need them to follow their dreams and to rethink culture. During the next years a new generation will rise with different ideas on work, consumption, culture and values. A generation not so optimistic as gen y. A generation which is focused on action, without fear of arguing. I think we will see more and more aspects of this new generation. A realistic but value driven generation.

Privacy will definitely become a big issue. De-facing, suspicious minds, small networks, VIP retail, identity hacks, … And in 2014 some key patents of 3D printing will expire. This will boost innovation initiatives in 3D printing. We are really looking forward to the outcome.    

**What do you think – if we look back on 2014 in 2020 – is ether a romantic feeling about this time?**

“This is the most exciting time in human history to grow up. The rules of our parents – get good grades, work hard, climb the corporate ladder, retire – are complete nonsense. This is the time for young people to rewrite the rulebooks, invent jobs and embrace the opportunities to connect with likeminded people across the world.” These are the words of James Aviaz (30), the brain behind the magazine, ‘Everything is Fucked, Everything is OK.’

We should be careful not to lapse into chronocentrism, but I think we live in a very interesting time. There are cultural en economic shifts happening. Maybe we will remember 2014 as a stressful period. The wild disruptive changes now and for the next years will dazzle people. I hope we will get the time to adapt and to find quality.

**What is important for the trend profession in 2013, 2014…?**

A bit of rock’n’roll. I understand the scientification process of the trend profession, but it shouldn’t totally displace our gut feeling. In a data era everybody has access to statistics, but few can interpret it and few spot the first signs of change. Besides, our job isn’t limited to observing. We also need to act and tell the story. Ideas are contagious. We must help this new movement to develop.

**Tom, I totally agree! Thank you!**

**Do you want to meet Tom live and see him on stage? Come to our AND BEYOND event on December, 11th in Amsterdam – Tom will be there!**
