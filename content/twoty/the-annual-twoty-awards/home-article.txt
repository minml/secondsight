**TWOTY AWARDS – MISSION**

**The future matters, that’s what we believe! The mission of the TWOTY Awards is to show case more, better and broader insights and ideas from various foresight experts – trendwatchers, trend forecasters and futurists.**

‘Share your idea about the future’. This is not only for trendwatchers or other foresight professionals, if you have thought about the future, please blow our mind!

**Why?**

The organisation of the TWOTY Awards believes that the professional foresight trade is important and needed in this world which is changing at an accelerating pace. Foresight experts help organisations to move along the time, to have a better grip on the signs of the time. The need for experts with knowledge, vision and views about the future is rising.

The industry of trend experts grows . Worldwide schools and universities are focusing on learning future and forecast study. If it is scenario writing or concepting, it helps businesses, organisations or institutions to understand and provide new ideas, insights or views about the changing world.

And, there are more future stories than one. That is why the organisation collects more views, ideas and stories that give direction to a (better) future. A jury of professionals will read the stories and discuss which are the most interesting views or insights to work on. The TWOTY Awards is an annual award moment to show and share the best stories with the public and media – press, captains of different industries – they all want to know what the next steps are to invest.

One of the main messages of the organisation of the TWOTY Awards is: there is not one winner – every year year we share more stories on the future – all the nominees are winners! It is an annual day to show the world the impact of the foresight and forecast profession and to showcase more and new views..
