Title: Our definition of a futurist

----

Text: For the TWOTY Awards and our work in Second Sight we formulated our own definition of futurists:

Futurists do research for the long distant future. They spot new spots on the horizon. They know what is scientifically possible then and are able to envision that future in a way. Think about the work of science fiction writers as Arthur C. Clarke or Alvin Toffler. Or research institutes as the Singularity Institute. How do we work or live in 2050 or 2080?

**Who dares?**
