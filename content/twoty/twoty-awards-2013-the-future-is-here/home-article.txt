Text: **The most interesting visions of the future**

The TWOTY – Trendwatcher of the Year Awards – are known as the ‘Oscars’ for visionaries. On September 13th the TWOTY Awards were presented in Amsterdam for the fifth time this year with the motto ‘The Future Matters’. The ceremony took place on the grounds of Houthavens Creative Lab, a creative hotspot in Amsterdam.

The winner of the 2013  TWOTY Award is Tom Palmaerts with the story ‘The future is here, and it is being built by young people’. Tom Palmaerts is a youth expert, and as the jury of this award said: ‘if you understand the young people, then you understand the future’. Showing new directions with his story, Tom calls his peers to action on the last sentence of his text: ‘We, as trendwatchers, don’t have the time to only observe, we need to act and tell the story. Ideas are contagious. We must help this new movement to develop’.

Tom Palmaerts is the successor of Reinier Evers, Adjiedj Bakas, Carl Rohde and Farid Tabarki as Trend Watcher Of The Year 2013.

Sara Peluso (Italy) from Studio Monomio is the winner of the Trend Forecaster of the Year 2013 award. Sara’s story is about the ‘The Progress of Image’ which ‘goes beyond sharing new ideas. It has a close relationship with product development and design to make the future happen’, the jury of this award says.

The Futurist of the Year 2013 is Yori Kamphuis with the story ‘From Globalization to Universalization’. ‘This vision has a focus on the human nature, on developments in society and technical developments – this includes a diversity of aspects of life and progress’, the jury says.

The upcoming talent 2013 is Paulien Routs. An honorable mention was awarded to Bibi Middelburg.

On this day the Second Sight Yearbook, ‘2014 And Beyond – Travelling Through Times’, was also presented. The book comprises more then 75 visions from national and international contributors for 2014 and coming years, including all the winning and nominated stories.

Second Sight organises the TWOTY awards since 2007. ‘With the TWOTY Awards we wish to share the visions of experts on the future – especially in this time, where there is a lot of attention on the recession‘, says Andrea Wiegman, the founder of Secondsight. Andrea goes on to explain the aims of the TWOTY, ‘the Awards were created in 2007 to further professionalise the area’s of expertise in trendwatching and trend forecasting. We also give attention to watching trends even further away, the area of expertise from futurists. We make a distinct difference between the Awards, between the visions of today and tomorrow, the visions about the world in 3 or 4 years, and the visions about the world in 20 or 30 years. We also aim to give trend information consumers more insight over this timespan and the speed of change. The future is immense and a growing number of people are paying attention to it. We also want to bring into the spotlight less known trendwatchers. These are experts with inspiring visions, who know how to carry them forward. And don’t forget, they will bring new insights: trendwatchers think from the angle of chances, not threats’.

An independent jury of innovation, marketing and communication professionals, such as magazine establishers, strategists and previous winners reviewed all the submitted trend stories. The best visions of the future were awarded in four different categories by four groups of juries.
