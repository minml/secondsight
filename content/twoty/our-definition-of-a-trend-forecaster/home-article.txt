Title: Our definition of a trend forecaster

Text: Share your secret!

For the TWOTY Awards and our work in Second Sight we formulated our own definition of trend forecasters:

Trend forecasters work on research about new and emerging topics, lifestyles or trends that are interesting for the industry to focus on and to prepare for. They spot developments in an early stage and are able to let them grow into the future. How do we create the future? What are the next steps?Say between 2015 and 2023?

Think about new technics, materials, colours and lifestyles.
