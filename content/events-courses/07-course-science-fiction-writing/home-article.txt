As Thimothy Mack says: “Science fiction is what future studies needs to be more like, and future studies is what science fiction needs to be more like. In other words, there isn’t enough of a connection now,” says Mack. “Future studies really needs to learn how to tell stories and help people understand the future in a more energetic and dynamic way using the kinds of images and emotional descriptions that science fiction is so good at. Science fiction needs to be much more careful about its science, and even more, its social science—how people really work, the psychology of humans, and the politics.”

Envisioning the future is the first step in creating it…  Sciencefiction writers have been doing this for hundreds of years, and many important innovations were first imagined in the pages of a sciencefiction novel.  Sciencefiction is the dreaming mind of science.  For this reason, Second Sight and Scifutures have created a Science Fiction Writing Bootcamp. This course is perfect for the aspiring sciencefiction writers or the business professional who hopes to use the disruptive insights from this genre can inspire for product development and business ideas.
