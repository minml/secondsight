----

Text: **DO IT YOURSELF - DO IT TOGETHER!**

**24 June 2014 - 24 June 2014
HOW TO TRACK TRENDS AND MAKE A TREND PRESENTATION YOURSELF?**

Second Sight organizes a special workshop for 1 DAY to learn more about trend research and forecasting.

The focus is on the DIY part of trend research and forecasting. While working on the future you can’t miss a vision or deeper understanding of the zeitgeist. Which trends do really matter? How can you translate them into today’s needs, products or services. And how do you use trends, eg. for vision development, strategy or concept development?

You will learn more about how to spot trends and putting them into a compelling story.

In the end of the day you will give a trend presentation by yourself or your team.

The workshop is for designers, creatives, strategists, marketers or communication experts, for entrepreneurs, innovators or change makers.
