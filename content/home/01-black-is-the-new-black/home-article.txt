Title: [BLACK IS THE NEW BLACK] #pt28#

Text: # SECONDSIGHT HAS CHANGED THE SCRIPT #pt18#

Since 1997, we‘ve been in the trends and foresight business - as publishers and network enablers. We’ve done our job well, but things have changed. So we’re changing too. We want to add more value to our trend research and foresights: to connect new dots and offer compelling research and stories. We want to call the shots as they are: BLACK IS THE NEW BLACK. Our future is not about one color anymore. More things work at the same time. The future is bright with so many colors, so many opinions and definitions and so many more stories that matter, that are all equally important.

We’ve been working to understand the spirit of our time. With a global network of researchers, time travelers, futurists and zeitgeist savvies, we offer unique methods of research, concept and visionary development for industry planners and decision makers. We’ve found new ways to tap into the opportunities and ideas that lie ahead. We travel ahead and back in time to understand the changes happening in our society as well as to showcase probable, possible and preferable futures. From analyzing consumer cultural trend content to science fiction writing, we help you through social strategies and influence management to understand, envision, invent and implement future strategies.

You can hire us for vivid views, new insights, reports and trend books. We work as a service-based research studio, a think tank specialized in early signals and new topics as they arise, delivering real and tangible stories about new visions for future development. Looking for new developments, new insights, new ideas or concepts, we write stories, custom-made reports and (link: http://www.secondsight.nl/issues/ text: books) to help you finding new pathways; we organize workshops, courses, mash-ups and (link: http://www.secondsight.nl/agenda/ text: workshops, courses, mash-ups and events). Having decided to make our work for our clients more exclusive, we’re closing our database with its more than 10,000 articles, views and visions gathered since 1997.  

Black is the new black, as we call this trend. Last but not least, we’ve started a (link: mailto:timetravelservice@secondsight.nl text: time travel service) to look for new opportunities. Our shop will open so with our new products and services.

On social media and in our (link: http://www.secondsight.nl/trendletter/ text: free trendletter), we’ll keep you up to date on what we’re doing. For your questions, requests for information or data stored in our databank, stories, reports, books or public-speaking engagements – please (link: mailto:askus@secondsight.nl text: call or email us)!
